  # Fix Certificate Policies

  1. Security
    - Update RLS policies for certificates table to allow proper insertion
    - Add policies for authenticated users to create and read certificates
    - Ensure proper access control for certificate operations

  2. Changes
    - Drop existing restrictive policies
    - Add permissive policies for certificate creation and reading
    - Allow users to create certificates when tests are passed
    - Allow users to read their own certificates and supervisors to read team certificates
