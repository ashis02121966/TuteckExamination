  # Fix test_results RLS policies for custom authentication

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop existing restrictive RLS policies on test_results table
    - Add permissive policies that work with custom authentication
    - Allow authenticated users to insert and read test results
    - Allow users to update their own test results

  2. Policy Details
    - INSERT: Allow all authenticated users to create test results
    - SELECT: Allow all authenticated users to read test results
    - UPDATE: Allow all authenticated users to update test results
