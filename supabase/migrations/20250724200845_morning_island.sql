/*
  # Fix test_results RLS policy for custom authentication

  1. Security Updates
    - Drop existing restrictive RLS policies on test_results table
    - Add permissive policies that work with custom authentication system
    - Allow authenticated users to insert their own test results
    - Allow users to read their own test results and supervisors to read team results

  2. Changes
    - Remove policies that depend on auth.uid() (Supabase Auth)
    - Add policies that work with custom user_id validation
    - Ensure test result creation works for all authenticated users
